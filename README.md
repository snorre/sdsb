# SDSB - SuperDuperSimpleBackup

Just a simple backupscript which I might use myself over a short period. This script probably has more improvement areas than ..well.. areas.

Use at your own risk.

## TODO
* Systemd timer setup
* Documentation
* Avoid taking a new snapshot if no files are transferred
* Reduce number of snapshots kept for a long time
* ..
